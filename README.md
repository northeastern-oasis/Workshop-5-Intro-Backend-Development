Congratulations on taking your first step into developing a backend for your application. As your project grows, backends become a necessity to facilitate splitting up app functionality, promoting app speed, and maintaining security.

In this workshop, we will start by introducing some topics related to backends, including the basics of REST API's and server requests. We will also talk about why we use backends, and end with an introduction to actually making one with Node.js and Express.

While this will be an introduction, it will set you up to continue learning and growing in these skills.


## Getting Started/Homework

This time, we'll be needing to work with and run files on our local system. To get set up with that, you'll need to go through the following steps:

1. Install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Just choose the LTS version, then go through installer steps.
2. Install Postman [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). This lets us make API requests
3. Install Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Choose your operating system, then go through installer steps.
4. Clone this Github repository into a new folder on your machine (in Terminal or Command Prompt, type `git clone REPO_URL`, where REPO_URL is the clone repository found on the top of this page
5. You're all set! Just have the cloned folder easily accessible and follow along with the workshop to start writing backend code


## After the Workshop

Well done finishing the workshop! You now have a better understanding of topics fundamental for creating a backend system. Soon, you will be deploying your own backend to communicate with your frontend applications. We would recommend the following steps to continue developing and learning:

* Create more endpoints for your application using Express
* Check out longer dedicated resources on the web, such as:

* Check out the Oasis Starting Guide section on backend development [here](https://github.com/northeastern-oasis/Ultimate-Oasis-Starting-Guide/tree/master/backend-dev)

## If you couldn't make the workshop

If you were not able to attend, don't worry! There are still many great ways to learn about the backend. We'd recommend checking out the resources listed above, as well as the [Oasis Starting Guide](https://github.com/northeastern-oasis/Ultimate-Oasis-Starting-Guide/tree/master/backend-dev). You can also still use the workshop files as a starting point for your coding. Good luck!

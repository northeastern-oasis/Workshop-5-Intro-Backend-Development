# Step 1: Our First Node App

**Note: completed code in `first-app-solution.js`--you should start in `first-app.js`**

### Objectives:
- Use Node to run JavaScript from a file, instead of through command line
- Import and use a Node module
- Create and write to a new file using Node

While using Node to run JavaScript through the console is fun, it is impractical for large, complex programs. Luckily, we can also put all our JavaScript into a file and have Node run the whole thing. Let's try that.

### Task:

Our goal is to run the file `first-app.js`. First we will finish writing it

1. Open the file, read through the comments, and do the challenges


### To Run the Node App:

**Note: you will need to kill the app (Ctrl/Cmd+C) and rerun it every time you make a change to your code. It doesn't automatically update! (Though it's easy to set that up, see [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/))**

When starting out, you will use the command line to run your node app. Simply open a terminal/command promprt at this window location:

1. On Windows, go to File -> Open Windows Powershell/Command Prompt
2. On Mac, go to Finder -> Services -> Open Terminal at this Location

To run the app, use the command `node FILE_NAME`, where FILE_NAME is, well, you know. Then hit enter.

So for this folder, you'd type `node first-app.js`

You can also just double-click the RUN APP(YOUR_OS) file for ease, but really try to use command line

# Step 0: Welcome to Node.js

### Objectives: 
* Discover Node.js on command line
* Print to console using Node.js

Welcome to Node.js! We will be using it along with Express, a backend framework, to create a small server that can handle incoming requests from us and return a result. 

Eventually, backends you create will be able to handle incoming requests of many types and holding different varieties of data, process that data and perhaps store some in a database, and send back detailed responses. One step at a time!

### Task

Our goal here is to try out Node.js——to do so, we're going to use the command line! We'll fire up Node, and then type some JavaScript code to see how it reacts

1. Open Command Prompt if you're on Windows, or Terminal if you're on Mac (just search for them if you can't find it)
2. Ensure you have Node installed. If not, see README in the folder above this
3. Type "node" (no quotes) into the terminal. If Node was installed correctly, you should see "Welcome to Node.js" followed by version info

You can now type JavaScript code in your console, which will be run by Node.js——this is cool stuff! 
Let's try some JavaScript code:

1. `let message = 'foo'`
	- This just creates a new variable and gives it the value 'foo'
2. `console.log(message)`
	- This will print the value of message to the console
3. Watch your message print out...cool right!

Now it's time to move on to bigger things
